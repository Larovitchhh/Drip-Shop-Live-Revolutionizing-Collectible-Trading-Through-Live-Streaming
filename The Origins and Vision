Drip Shop Live was born from the personal passion of its CEO and co-founder, Javaughn Lawrence, a Jamaican immigrant who discovered Pokémon and Yu-Gi-Oh! cards as a way to connect with American culture after moving to the U.S. at age 10. 

 What started as a hobby evolved into a full-fledged business, with the platform putting over $100 million in sales back into the hands of small business owners and creators. 

 Lawrence's vision was simple yet ambitious: create a "TikTok for collectibles" where streamers can monetize their expertise, buyers can engage in real-time bidding, and communities can flourish around shared interests like sports cards, Pokémon TCG, Magic: The Gathering, and One Piece TCG.

The platform's live format replicates the excitement of in-person trading events, fostering camaraderie through chat interactions, giveaways, and collaborative content. 

 It's not just about transactions; Drip emphasizes community-building, allowing creators to earn from the collectibles they love while viewers discover rare finds like graded slabs, mystery boxes, or vintage items.
